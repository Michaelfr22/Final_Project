            <h1 class="front-page">Overview</h1>
            <p class="front-page">  More and more rapidly, the world is starting to notice the effects of global climate change. It's no longer a debate; it's undeniable. Historic flooding,
                unprecedented drought, & devastating wildfires displacing millions of people are among some of the more drastic and noticable effects of climate change. Gases such as CO2,
                Methane, and Nitrous Oxide are primary culprits in creating a "greenhouse effect" that traps more heat from the sun, steadily increasing the average temperatures
                around the globe. These "greenhouse gases" are emitted in the greatest quantities by the most advanced nations, and the United States is no exception. In 2018 alone, the United
                States emitted <b>6,677 Million Metric Tons of CO2e</b> as a whole.
            </p>
            <p class="front-page">    
                    For our final project as part of the Rutgers University Data Analysis Boot Camp, our group chose to analyze the emission levels across the United States, finding
                which states are the greatest polluters, which sectors within those states produce the largest amount of emissions, and measure those emissions against State population
                and Gross Domestic Profit (GDP). Then, using Machine Learning, we hope to predict the emission levels going forward, based on past emissions, Population, and GDP.

            <h1 class="front-page">Hypothesis</h1>
            <p class="list">
                Using the features GDP, Population, and past GHG emissions, we will try to0 predict future GHG emissions for each state and the sectors within those states.
            </p>
            <h3>Questions to Answer</h3>
            <p class="list">
                - What correlation, if any, exists between State GDP and GHG Emission levels?<br>
                - What correlation, if any, exists between State Population and GHG Emission levels?<br>
                - Over the course of 1990 to 2018, which States have the highest emissions? The lowest?<br>
                - Can we predict GHG Emissions through State Population and GDP?

            <h3>Initial Analysis<br></h3>
               <h5>Our initial analysis provided the following interesting & promising results:<br></h6>
               <p class="list">
                - States with larger populations tended to produce greater GHG emissions, but it was not a linear increase.<br>
                - The highest emissions sector in every State is the Energy sector.<br>
                - The highest polluting state in the country is Texas, followed by California, then Pennsylvania and Florida fighting for the Bronze medal.<br>
                - The largest total GDP over 1997-2018 in the country is California at $198 Trillion, with Texas and New York an order of magnitude behind at $128 Trillion and 118 Trillion.<br>
                - The highest population States in 2018 are California at 39M, Texas at 28M, & Florida at 28M, with New York close behind at 19M.<br>
                </p>
            <h3>Machine Learning<br></h3>
                <h5>To test our hypothesis, we utilized three different Machine Learning models:<br></h6>
                <h4>Linear Regression<br></h4>
                <p class="list">
                    - Using Linear Regression, we attempted to find a correlation between GDP, Population, and GHG emissions.<br>
                    - Due to the ever-increasing nature of these features, we were unable to find any useful correlation that was not already obvious.<br>
                    - From here, we moved on to unsupervised models.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Random Forest Classifier<br></h4>
                <p class="list">
                    - The model was trained on data aggregated as averages, in order to scale each feature and account for differences in land size.<br>
                    - The training score was 0.95, a promising result, but the inital test was only 0.69. Still decent, but not reliable.<br>
                    - When running the trained model on our existing data, we found it was unusable on real data, with a negative testing score.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>K-Means Clustering<br></h4>
                <p class="list">
                    - We used the Elbow Method to determine how many clusters to target using the model, resulting in 4 ideally.<br>
                    - While this model was not wholly successful, it did help us come to the conclusion that our hypothesis was null.<br>
                    - Clustering provided no correlation between Population and GHG or GDP and GHG.<br>
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion<br></h3>
                <p class="list">
                    We will need more data, with ideally other features, in order to properly predict GHG Emissions going forward.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Possible Improvements:<br></h4>
                <p class="list">
                    - Take into account political leanings for each State.<br>
                    - Find what sectors in each State produce the highest GDP.<br>
                    - Find what sectors in each State receive the most funding.<br>
                    - Take into account the irregularities that COVID-19 may have caused in the data.<br>
